            <p id="about-description">
                As a Data Professional I have a strong passion for developing Dashboards, Reports, Data Models and Performance related insights. Since I can map the Business Requirements as a Data Analyst Specialist then translate them into operational dashboard and Performance related insights, I can always develop a solution without any miss communication with stakeholders. With Data Analyst expertise I can also perform advanced analytics to large data sets. Automating the processes concerning Data Extraction and Data Transformation also falls under my expertise. Hard skills: Python, R, SQL, Snowflake, Power BI, SAS, Excel, Git.
